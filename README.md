# Part 1 - Development

## Project Brief

* You are tasked with producing an HTML version of the mockup in the `assets` folder
* The page should be responsive to all common screen sizes (Bootstrap breakpoints are fine)
* "Pixel perfection" is **not** a requirement, but it should look as close to the mockup as reasonably possible
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) should be used as the base css framework (*already included in `index.html`*)
* Feel free to Google, use StackOverflow, etc. No one is expected to code in isolation!
* You will be evaluated on your approach to solving the challenges presented by the design, along with code quality
* Any forms present in the mockup are not expected to submit their data anywhere

### Starting Development

* Fonts required for the mockup are available in the `assets/fonts` folder
* Mockup files in Figma format is available in the `assets` folder (use [Figma](https://figma.com) if you are a Windows user)
* For your convenience, [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Google Material Symbols](hhttps://fonts.google.com/icons)(https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_symbols) have been added to the `index.html` file
